    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Sorbet is a refreshing frozen dessert that is easy to make and endlessly adaptable. It typically consists of water, 
      sugar, and fruit. In this case, it features an herb. This recipe focuses on mint and as a result, becomes even more 
      refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike ice cream, sorbet doesn't have a lot of air in it, and so it is dense and the flavor can be more intense. You 
      just bring together mint, water, and sugar in a saucepan to make a simple syrup. Additional sweetness and flavor come 
      from white wine and lemon juice, and the sorbet comes together to achieve the perfect texture in an ice cream maker.
