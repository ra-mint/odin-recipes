        The technique for how to make French toast is straightforward. All you need are common pantry items like eggs, milk, 
        brown sugar, spices, and vanilla then you’re ready to dip! Toast the bread, soak in the custard, and fry until crisp 
        and puffy. You can now enjoy a homemade bistro-style dish without having to change out of your pajamas.

    <div class="recipe desc_text steps">
      <ol>
        <li>Set the oven rack to the middle postion. Preheat to 300ºF (149ºC). Place bread on a wire rack set inside of a baking sheet</li>
        <li>Toast the bread for 14 minutes, flipping halfway through cook time. It should be dry to the touch but not browned. After removing from the oven, the bread will become drier as it cools at room temperature</li>
        <li>In a large shallow bowl thoroughly whisk together the milk, eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt</li>
        <li>Soak each slice of bread for 15 to 20 seconds on each side. Use a spatula to transfer to a separate baking sheet. Whisk the custard as needed in between batches to keep the ingredients mixed. Sprinkle more cinnamon on top if desired.</li>
        <li>Heat a 12-inch nonstick pan or cast iron skillet over medium-low heat. Melt 1/2 tablespoon of butter in the pan until it bubbles</li>
        <li>Add two pieces of bread at a time. Cook until the first side is golden brown, dry to the touch, and lightly crisp, about 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the bread over and cook the other side until golden, about 3 to 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Wipe out the pan and add fresh butter, repeat the cooking process with the remaining dipped bread</li>
        <li>Right before serving sprinkle powdered sugar on top of the warm French toast. Serve with maple syrup</li>
