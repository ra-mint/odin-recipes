## Recipe website lesson from The Odin Project

This is a project by The Odin Project that will use the skills that I
have learned so far. Though the lessons have been relatively a lot of
research and watching videos, I have enjoyed it so far. I feel as
though it is preparing me for what's to come.

So far, I have learned:
- making a boilerplate
- using `<head>` and `<body>` elements
- inflection markers such as `<em>` and `<strong>`
- unordered and ordered lists
- images and links

I'm **really** enjoying what I'm learning so far and I cannot wait to
learn even more in web development. I'm hoping to eventually apply my
skills towards full stack development employment.
